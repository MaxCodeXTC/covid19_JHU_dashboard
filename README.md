# covid19_JHU_dashboard

This bash script pull the data from JHU dashboard https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 (**not Github**) in real-time and use **JQ** to clean the JSON and convert the JSON to newline delimiter JSON (the JSON format which is required to load into Google BigQuery)

I've been using this method for a month for my interactive dashboard on Google Data Studio: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/f56febd8-5c42-4191-bcea-87a3396f4508
